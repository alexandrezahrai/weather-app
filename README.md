# Weather App

### JavaSript, Sass, HTML

The goal of this project was to test my skills fetching data using an API. In this case I utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to gather and display weather forecasts for various cities in different countries. Additionally, I used this project to practice using CSS preprocessors like Sass.
